# Vault Authentication Methods
.center[![:scale 45%](images/vault_auth_methods.png)]
.center[Vault supports many different authentication methods.]

???
* Auth methods are how your apps and users verify their identity.
* In the same way you might present some kind of valid ID at the hotel check-in desk, users and apps provide some kind of credential or token to authenticate.
* You can enable multiple auth methods and multiple instances of the same auth method.

# Enabling Authentication Methods

* Most Vault auth methods need to be explicitly enabled.
* This is done with the `vault auth enable` command.
* Each auth method has a default path.
* Alternate paths can be specified to enable multiple instances:<br> `vault auth enable -path=aws-east aws`
* Custom paths must be specified in CLI commands and API calls:<br>
`vault write aws-east/config/root`<br>
instead of<br>
`vault write aws/config/root`

???

* Talk about enabling auth methods.
* Talk about default and custom paths
* Explain the examples

# Vault's Userpass Auth Method
.center[![:scale 30%](images/userpass_login.png)]
* The Userpass method authenticates users with usernames and passwords managed by Vault.

???
* The Userpass method allows users to authenticate with username and password managed by Vault.
* It is not recommended for production, but it's fine for development and lab environments.
* In the real world you'd probably have Vault use your Active Directory, LDAP, GitHub, or other system of record for authentication by users.
